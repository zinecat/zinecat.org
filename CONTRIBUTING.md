# Contributing to The Zine Union Catalog

>Thank you for your interest in contributing to The Zine Union Catalog :tada:! 

>ZineCat is... 

There is no one central catalog (a database of library holdings) for searching and finding zines. In the US, [Worldcat.org](www.worldcat.org) provides access to a union catalog, but it is mostly for books, journals, and audio visual materials. Zine and zine collections are not consistently cataloged in WorldCat.

The Zine Union Catalog (ZUC) fills a gap by providing a searchable platform to discover zines and zine collections.

*Why* should you contribute?

>ZineCat is for everyone as zines are for everyone.  Zine creators are empowered and motivated to share knowledge, often outsdie of traditional or mainstream communication channels.  The zine culture is a do-it-yourself (DIY), anarchopunk, give a voice to the marginalized and we want you to get involved.  Contributing to ZineCat could make a difference to the world!
