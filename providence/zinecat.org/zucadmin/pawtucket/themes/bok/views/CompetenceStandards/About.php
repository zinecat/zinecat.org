				<strong>Competence</strong> is the proven ability to do a job; it is often defined in terms of the required combination of skills, knowledge and attitude. <strong>Skills</strong> ensure the ability to perform a task reliably and consistently, <strong>knowledge</strong> provides an understanding of the technical and theoretical background to the task and an appreciation of its purpose; and having the right <strong>attitude</strong> helps ensure than an individual works professionally, ethically and conscientiously. <strong>Competence</strong> focuses primarily on the actual ability of individuals to perform in their jobs effectively, rather than on delivery of training and acquisition of qualifications.

				In the last 20 years, there has been increasing interest in adopting a competence-based approach to guide the professionalizations – the professional development, assessment, and certification – of protected area staff. The framework used here has been developed by the IUCN WCPA Capacity Development Programme.   
			</p>
			<p>
				The competences are based on four <strong>Levels</strong> of personnel, based on the type of work and responsibility required of individuals. The levels are summarised in the table below. (Level 1, Unskilled Worker, is not used in this portal)

				In addition, 14 <strong>categories</strong> are defined, based on typical jobs and sets of skills in protected area work. The category are arranged in three groups as shown in the table. Each category has a three letter code.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each category contains multiple <strong>competence units</strong>, distinguished by a unique <strong>code and number</strong>, e.g. BIO 3.1 means Biodiversity Conservation category, Level 3, Competence Unit 1.  <i>Materials coded to this Competence Element will be suitable for Middle Managers or Technical Specialists looking to build their competence in Biodiversity Conservation, or for Skilled Workers who are looking to advance by enhancing their knowledge in this area.  The portal will make sure you get access to the appropriate resources by asking you to provide information on your level when you register on the website and making sure suitable material shows up whenever you log in.</i>
