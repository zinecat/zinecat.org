		<H5>About Susan Eley Fine Art</H5>
		<p>
			Susan Eley Fine Art was founded in the spring of 2006 by Eley as a salon-style gallery. Situated in an Upper West Side Townhouse in Manhattan, the Gallery offers an intimate, personal viewing experience, contrary to the more formal presentations of art in typical white box galleries. Eley opened the Gallery to attract a new, untapped audience for contemporary art and to provide regular gallerygoers with a fresh, alternative way to enjoy art.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Gallery focuses on contemporary art by emerging and mid-career artists, who work in a range of media, from paint to photography to sculpture and print. Solo and group exhibitions showcase abstract as well as figurative work from a diverse body of artists from the U.S., Asia, Latin America and Europe. Gallery artists are dynamic, active professionals, who produce strong bodies of work that constantly shift and evolve.
		</p>
		<p>
			An inaugural opening reception marks the start of each exhibition.
		</p>
		<p>
			Gallery Hours: Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday, 11am-5pm and by appointment.
