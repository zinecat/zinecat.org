		<p>The e-flux reading room opened in 2008 at <a href='http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/the-building-2/' target='_blank'>the building</a> in Berlin to build a public archive documenting international exhibitions, ephemera, and symposia on contemporary art through donated publications from both institutions and individuals. After moving to e-fluxâ€™s 41 Essex Street location in 2009, the reading room library found its current home in the e-flux office on the 3rd floor of 311 East Broadway, NY in 2011. The library currently holds over 4000 publications from over 700 contributors. </p>
		<p>In 2015, the reading room website was created to provide access to a browsable catalog and digital publications available PDF format. The online catalog establishes a public database, drawing relationships between not only books and their contributors, but also authors, editors, publishers, formats, and more.</p>
		<p>If you would like to add a publication to the reading room, please email <a href='mailto:erin@e-flux.com'>erin@e-flux.com</a> or send books by mail to e-flux at 311 East Broadway FL 3 New York, NY 10002. The reading room is open by appointment Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday 10am-6pm.</p>
