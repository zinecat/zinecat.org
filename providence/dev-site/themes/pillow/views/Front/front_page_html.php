			<p>The Jacob's Pillow Archives document the history of the Festival and School and the artists who have taken part in these activities, with particular emphasis on Ted Shawn, Ted Shawn's Men Dancers, and the Denishawn Company.</p>
			<p>The collection includes correspondence, photographs, programs, board minutes, books, costumes, posters, films, audiotapes, and scrapbooks. The Archives is one component of the Pillow's Preservation Program, which also documents the ongoing activities of the Festival, principally on video, and organizes exhibits exploring various aspects of dance history. </p>
