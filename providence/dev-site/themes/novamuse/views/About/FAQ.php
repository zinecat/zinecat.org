	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<div class="textContent">
		<div>
			<b>Why aren’t all of the museums in Nova Scotia represented on NovaMuse?</b><br/>
			Participation in NovaMuse is voluntary, and currently part of ANSM’s Advisory Service. Interested organizations should contact the ANSM office to learn more.
		</div>
		<div>
			<b>Who decides what objects to contribute?</b><br/>
			Contributing institutions decide which records and images can be made available online and are responsible for clearing all copyright and intellectual property rights. Questions about content should be directed to the associated institution.
		</div>
		<div>
			<b>Why should I create an account?</b><br/>
			Creating an account will let you tag keywords and leave comments on records. It will also let you use the lightbox – a feature that lets you tag and create slideshows of your favourite items. It’s free and easy to do, and we will not sell or share your information with anyone.
		</div>
		<div>
			<b>Can I ask a question or add information to a record?</b><br/>
			Yes! Once you have an account you can sign in and leave a comment on any object’s record. The comments will be moderated by the individual sites and they will respond as soon as possible. Keep in mind that many museums are volunteer-run and only open seasonally, so please be patient with them.
		</div>
		<div>
			<b>Why don’t all of the records have images?</b><br/>
			Most museums have a backlog in this area, so it is a work in progress. As items are photographed and/or scanned, the website will be updated.
		</div>
		<div>
			<b>Can I download images for my own use?</b><br/>
			No. All content is the property of the contributing institution. If you wish to obtain a copy of an image you see on NovaMuse, you should contact the institution directly. 
		</div>
		<div>
			<b>Can I go and see an object in person?</b><br/>
			Absolutely! But keep in mind that many museums are only open during the summer months. They also have multiple buildings and storage areas, and lend objects to other museums for temporary exhibits. If you want to learn more about a particular item, contact the museum to figure out the best time to visit.
