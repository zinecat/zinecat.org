				Assessment and certification of PA professionals helps ensure that those responsible for protecting valuable resources are competently performing their jobs. Built upon clear competence standards and guidelines, certification programs can provide feedback to individuals (and their employers) on their performance while highlighting opportunities for continuing professional development.  Certification works together with the Body of Knowledge and Competence Standards to provide a consistent approach to developing a professional PA workforce.

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<p>
				1.	<strong>Guidelines</strong> documenting the process for establishing a certification program including key elements and factors for success. These guidelines are best suited for those that want to design their own competence-based certification systems, but who wish to align their programs with the IUCN to be consistent with the international community and potentially receive IUCN endorsement.
			</p>
		</div><!--end col-sm-6-->
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<p>
				2.	A <strong>model certification program</strong> providing an example of what a full certification program could look like and how the competences should be organized into a certification program with assessment instruments. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Regional or national bodies can opt to build their certification program using the model or they can design their own. If their program meets the IUCN standards, they will be able to apply for IUCN endorsement.
