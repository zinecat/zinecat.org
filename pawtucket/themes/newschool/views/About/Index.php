		<h2 style="margin-top:0;">The New School Archives: Digital Collections is the online portal for the digital collections of the New School Archives & Special Collections, which is a unit of the New School's Libraries & Archives.</h2>

		<p>The New School Archives & Special Collections has grown out of the Kellen Design Archives, which documents the history of Parsons The New School for Design and twentieth century design history. Currently the expanded New School and Special Collections also contains rapidly growing collections from across all divisions of The New School. To learn more about the New School Archives and Special Collections and its holdings, please visit our <a href=”http://library.newschool.edu/speccoll”>website</a>.</p>

		<p>This site provides access to approximately 4,000 digital objects consisting of images, textual records, audio, and video, primarily digitized from physical archival collections. It was created using CollectiveAccess, free open-source software for managing and publishing museum and archival collections. Cataloging profiles were developed to adhere to <a href=”http://www.vraweb.org/projects/vracore4/”>VRA Core 4.0</a> for still images and textual records and <a href=”http://www.pbcore.org”>PBCore</a> for time-based material.</p>

		<p>Items on the site include fashion design drawings, fashion illustrations, photographs, building plans, interior design renderings, student notebooks, scrapbooks, magazine and advertisement proofs, paintings, audio from oral histories and public programming, and a small amount of video. They can be browsed by selected topics such as interior or fashion design, or by archival collections, usually organized by the person or organization responsible for their creation. Short descriptions of collections included on this site are excerpted from longer <a href=”http://library.newschool.edu/speccoll/kellen/findingaids/”>Collection Guides</a>, which can be consulted for more contextual information as well as descriptions of material that has not been digitized but is available to researchers able to visit the archives.</p>
		<p>New materials and descriptions are continually being added, so check back often for updates. Please <a href="http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/index.php/Contact/send">contact us</a> with any feedback, questions, to request high resolution scans, or make an appointment to visit the archives in person.</p>
