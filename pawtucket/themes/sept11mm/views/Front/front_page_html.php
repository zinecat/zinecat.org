				The Museum collects, preserves, documents, exhibits, interprets and makes available as a public learning resource the material evidence, primary testimony and expanding historical record of response to the terrorist events of February 26, 1993, and September 11, 2001, and their global repercussions.
 			</p>
 			<p>
				With the goal of serving as an authoritative gateway of information about these incidents, the Museum acquires wide-ranging materials in various media, for commemoration, education, display, publication and scholarship. The Permanent Collection functions as an extensive reservoir of historical facts, trustworthy content and cumulative insight that will deepen over time, with uses beyond physical exhibition.
 			</p>
 			<p>
				This website highlights a portion of the Permanent Collection including objects visible in the Museum but also highlighting objects that are currently not on display.  The content on this site is intended to expand to include the majority of our holdings and will eventually incorporate digital media and Oral Histories.
 			</p>
 			<p>
				The Collections Policy is available for review on the 9/11 Memorialâ€™s website: <a href="http://www.911memorial.org" target="_blank">www.911memorial.org</a>.</p>
