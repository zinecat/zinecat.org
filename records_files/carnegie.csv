That story could've ended there, but much like a great conversation, she leads us off into other territory before we really even know it.

Friends come back or bond closer in a world peppered with nostalgia and well...hope. We follow along as the city empties. We follow along as the city survives. We follow along as our author navigates the difficulties of New Orleans rebuilding. Going away and coming back; home is never the same and memories lines every curve.""

There are also a few summertime travel stories to unwind as the school year ends. It is about students and teachers learning from one another, creating together, and hopefully becoming better folks in the meantime.

We find Stacey reclaiming the forms of empowerment she knew in her youth, relearning to love her body, and standing up for herself. Her writing is filled with nostalgia and dreams for the future. It is text-heavy, well-written and pretty inspiring. It seems like leaving Chicago was good for Stacey, as this issue of zine seems like she is in a much better place in Georgia. This is about her time to relearn, to enjoy her youth again, to stop regretting the decisions she has made and to DO THINGS FOR HERSELF. It is really good to read this and feel her regaining her passion for writing, for her new home, and for her life. And you can't but help feel re-energized by her decision to start sticking up for herself.""

Issues of Ladyfriend were selected for the 2003 and 2005 tours of North America by Mobilivre-Bookmobile, the travelling library of independent publications.

Ladyfriend periodically tours the country with readings and public workshops: Editor/Publisher Christa Donner teams up with local ladyfriends in each city to read stories out loud, play a human-sized board game with audience members, and collect words of wisdom for another of her zine projects called Free Advice.""

His early life was spent without a permanent home. Baca lived with his grandmother when he was two after his mother and father divorced. Later his mother was murdered by her second husband, and from the ages of five to eleven, Baca lived at the St. Anthony's Home for Boys in Albuquerque. At twenty-one he was sentenced to six years in a maximum security prison in Arizona. Baca received his GED while in prison. Self-taught, he studied Spanish and read Pablo Neruda, Juan Ramon Jimenez and Federico Garcia Lorca; and in English he read William Wordsworth, Mary Baker, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Robert Frost, Ezra Pound and Walt Whitman. His formal education includes two degrees from the University of New Mexico: a B.A., 1984, and a Ph. D., 2003. 

From prison, he first submitted his poetry to Mother Jones magazine. BacaÛªs poetry includes the following works: Jimmy Santiago Baca, 1978; Immigrants in Our Own Land: Poems, 1979 and 1990; Swords of Darkness, 1981; What's Happening, 1982; Poems Taken from My Yard, 1986; Martin and Meditations on the South Valley, 1987; Black Mesa Poems, 1989; Working in the Dark: Reflections of a Poet of the Barrio, 1992; Set This Book on Fire! , 2001; Healing Earthquakes: A Love Story in Poems, 2001; C-train (Dream Boy's Story): and, Thirteen Mexicans , 2002; and Winter Poems along the Rio Grande, 2004. In 1987 he received a National Endowment for the Arts grant for poetry. Other honors include being named a poet in residence at University of California, Berkeley, the recipient of the Berkeley Regents' Fellowship in 1989 and the Wallace Stevens Fellowship in 1990 from Yale University. 

About his prison experience, Baca said, ""[In prison], I saw all these Chicanos going out to the fields and being treated like animals. I was tired of being treated like an animal. I wanted to learn how to read and to write and to understand. ... I wanted to know how to function in this world. Why was I so ignorant and deprived? ... The only way of transcending was through language and understanding. Had I not found the language, I would have been a guerrilla in the mountains. It was language that saved [me]."" ""

It's not a complaint, exactly, and not a celebration, either, but just a matter-of-fact documentation of a young man living life in a sort of hovering fuzzball of nothingness. Most of us go through this phase, and either end up with typical middle class lives or dead in a ditch from general unpremeditated stupidity.

There are maybe a dozen short stories in this little book, each primarily supporting a series of crisply-drawn B&W panels of ink on paper. The events are mundane -- getting coffee, watching power plant lights flash, visiting New York, being mistaken for a blind date. The effect is strangely attractive -- no sense of foreboding or hostility enters into the read, you just groove along with Al's life as basically nothing happens. When you get to the end, you flip back and look at a few images, and remember what they illustrated, and even that begins to disassociate in your mind. Not bad.

It's about 4"" by 5.5"" and runs 70 pages in length, and has a color photo on the cover, of a stuffed chair comfortably illuminated by daylight coming through a window. Let me tell you what is in this zine... 

The first two pages are autobiographical, a letter to readers telling us what she is doing. This is, in my opinion, an example of the weakness of most zines - they assume we care about the writer for no particular reason other than that they are who they are. Now, if the writer has an exceptionally interesting, unusual life, beset by odd or amazing circumstances, or, if the writer happens to be a friend I haven't spoken to in years, this would be reasonable. Otherwise, it represents an unrealistic expectation (for me). But Tara is only in keeping with the zine genre in writing about herself so much, so I can't fault her. It probably wouldn't bother most zine lovers. (I should note now that the majority of the writing in this 70 pager was interesting to me.) 

The dedication of the zine, on page 3, is ""To all library employees, everywhere,"" and it is library employees who will most appreciate this zine. The first item (the most autobiographical of the lot) is ""A Day in the Life of a Technical Services Employee,"" and it was by far the least interesting to me. It describes everything she did during one day at work. I think this one could have been left out, or at least not made the lead article. But Tara's writing is not bad, and some may enjoy this intimate glimpse into another person's life (and workplace). 

Following some some nice color-xeroxed images of her library, the next item is ""DeKalb Public Library as breeding ground for artistic self-actualization: a mini-drama in three acts."" Although also autobiographical, this story is where the zine starts to pick up the momentum that made me read the whole thing without putting it down. It's about psychological test that was given to the library employees and how it justified all of her quirkiness by showing that she is an ""originator,"" who is comfortable with and a bringer of change (unlike her fellow library employees, who are all sticks-in-the-mud). I liked what this said about Tara, and enjoyed her feeling of vindication, but I didn't like what it said about librarians in Tara's eyes. (Tara doesn't have an MLIS, and at the time of the zine's writing she had just decided NOT to get one, but to get an MFA in creative writing instead, because she ""wants to be surrounded by ideas and art instead of information."") Anyway... it's hard not to identify with a creative person telling a story of not entirely fitting in and finding a positive reason why not. 

More items include a tip to watch the video Puss in Boots, about library cats; ""Teacake,"" about sewing and midwestern womanhood... ""Notable libraries of the world""... a small, funny item about kid's versions of the apocalyptic, born-again ""Left Behind"" series... ""Sex in the library (to the tune of Love in the Afternoon): An unrequited library love story,"" which contains no sex, unless you count graphic descriptions of a heavy crush... ""The Libraries of My Youth: a rambling, unedited filler piece,"" actually much better than the title indicates, a nice reminiscence... ""Library Fashion,"" about how librarians all wear cardigans, sensible shoes, long skirts, etc. - my other least favorite part of this zine, really
annoying... ""Bearsuit: a dream that may or may not be related to working at a library,"" about wearing a bearsuit to her first day at her new job in a fancy store and wondering whether it was appropriate attire... ""MAMLSMFABAMLSM.... or you think you have a mish-mosh career? you read this,"" about the path she took to non-librarianship and where it goes from here... ""The Library Redeemed,"" about great CD's and other things she found in her library (though why the library needs to be redeemed is left unstated and is like the white elephant in the room)... ""The Library as Healer,"" the best thing in the zine, in my opinion, about how the library cured her of Chi depletion (republished in this issue of Library Juice)... ""Some books I came across while working at the library that I might not have otherwise read""... ""Library Web Sites""... ""The Most Frequently Banned Books in the 90's""... ""People's Fave Things About Libraries (excerpts from a small survey) - a great little piece, the bulk of which is made up of Tara's own favorite things about libraries, which she describes with tenderness and intelligence... ""The Patrons I Love,"" also described with tenderness and intelligence, the other best part of the zine... ""Library Ghost Stories""... ""Library Field Trip: Naperville Public Library, Naperville, IL,"" a review in which her one complaint is that the ""fiction tree"" in the YA section, which has ""leaves"" with booklists by category, has no category for ""freak""... ""Cool Facts"" about libraries, and an epilogue, where she tells us where she's at.""

A fascinating perspective and set of writings exploring what is a day to day occurance for millions of minority people living in small towns - being tokenized because of their race (or other features) and trying to remain connected to their culture. X talks about her Chinese acquantences and the difference between being 1st and 3rd generation immigrants.

Jasmine doesn't need to prove her own hipness to us; she simply relates a story that is important to her and written well enough to interest a stranger as well. Anyone who went to summer camp, who started listening to the Beatles in middle school, or who reminisces over childhood mementos will appreciate her perspective. The artwork, which in any other context might seem silly and carefree (butterflies, photographs of friends), comes across as mournful in this zine: the butterflies are in Xeroxed black and white, and coins block peoples' faces from view. Overall, Songs About Ghosts is as haunting as its title suggests.""

Several of their performances bring to light the biofictions inherent in assisted reproductive technologies. 

U-Gen-A-Chix: Cultures of Eugenics, staged as part of the YOUgenics exhibition in 2003, was one such participatory performance. These titles already announce the kind of biofiction at the core of assisted reproductive technologies, pointing to the intimate connection between this bioscience and eugenics and the status of woman as a breeder. Of course, the female body and the issue of motherhood have been a subject of contestation for some time now. However, subRosa identifies nascent problems arising from developments in this bioscience, specifically linking human-assisted reproductive technologies to the genetic engineering of chickens, pharming, cloning, and eugenic breeding. 

The pamphlet, distributed to the participants of the performance, U-Gen-A-Chix: Cultures of Eugenics, posed the provocative question: ÛÏWhy are women like chickens?! So that the participants of the performance might uncover the biofictions inherent in reproductive technologies and establish their positions in this regard, SubRosa set up two performance booths, one that provided information on human egg donations and the consequences of reducing the female to the status of a breeder of designer babies.""

When it seems like everything other form of communication has devolved into instantaneous sputtering, zines remain stubbornly slow. If I had to name one zine that exemplifies zine-time for me it would be Thoughtworm by Sean Stewart. IÛªve been reading Thoughtworm since 2004. Over these past five years IÛªve read six issues of this zine. When youÛªre contact with something is as sporadic as this, small changes tend to take on greater significance. WhatÛªs been most interesting to me has been the way SeanÛªs writing has gradually grown more oblique over the years. If you enjoy writing that is clear, yet has itÛªs own sort of logic, you really ought to get this.

Thoughtworm is mostly comprised of SeanÛªs journal entries. The entries are usually fairly short, but theyÛªre often not particularly to the point. ThatÛªs not to say the writing is obtuse or difficult. The sentences are straight-forward and well formed and they draw you in. But this is where things get odd, because by the end of many of these entries youÛªre not really sure what youÛªve been told. TheyÛªre almost like tone poems. Everything makes perfect sense, but itÛªs certainly not obvious what itÛªs all about. This isnÛªt an easy thing to pull off without resorting to drivel. But thereÛªs none of that here. Instead you get short, strong stories with a depth that betrays the small space they occupy. Typically, I donÛªt have much use for this sort of writing, but right now Sean is one of my favorite writers in or out of zines.

Thoughtworm 15 is a bit different from the previous issues IÛªve seen in that itÛªs nearly evenly divided between a few essays Sean has written and his journal entries. I liked the essays, but for me they donÛªt have the same driven quality that makes his journal writing so unique. Still, itÛªs all interesting and thoughtfully written and in the end these pieces provide a nice contrast to the journal writing. This is a zine well worth checking out.""

You may have correctly guessed from the title that it is a zine composed primarily of lists.

We are also treated to a list of phrases repeatedly uttered by an office co-worker named Vince. For instance, ""up the butt in Alligators,"" and""low-hanging fruit."" This is some funny stuff if you like silly light-hearted humor. Oh, and in case you were wondering, ""a bunch of earwigs being hit by lightning"" is ""Hot.""

I loved the first piece where Celia looks with sympathy on what would appear to be an out of control mother cursing at her kids on the el train. So often zines are about calling out bad behavior, and frankly zine writers can be kind of superior about such things sometimes. But here we see another mother who understands bad days and expectations that don't always come true.

The next essay is a piece about her family and childhood. If you know Celia, you know that she's not always the most forthcoming person, except in her writing. The way orderly librarians flock to chaotic, difficult to catalog zines, I think a lot of private people embrace a controlled distribution print medium like this to explore and share parts of themselves that they wouldn't have an outlet for otherwise.

Probably the most affecting part of this issue though is her ""Daybook"" entries of what she does with her time while her spouse and three-year-old son are away visiting relatives. You might think that she'll be busting loose with all that single, childfree time, and she does have a good run at errands and stuff, but really I think she's kind of freaked when she finds herself with all that time to herself, which is something I can totally relate to. I always want a day off from work, and I'm more psyched for time alone than Eric would probably like me to be when he goes out of town, but when it comes down to it, I quickly get kind of bored. I don't do a million productive things or go out wilding with the girls; I mess around on Facebook, play WordsPlay, and watch romantic comedies. And the weirdest thing is that like Celia, I sometimes get scared alone in the apartment.

There are also lists, a brownie recipe, and book recommendations to round out the lovely 26-pager. I think I may have said too much about it and that this was really more of a letter to Celia, but I do hope you'll consider acquiring IDIWA for your personal or library zine collection. Send her a nice message and tell her who you are and why you want her zine. Or ask for her postal address and arrange a trade. This girl really likes mail!""

The writing is journal-like and stream of consciousness, focusing on the minute details of the day as well as interpretations of the bigger picture issues (Why are we getting up in the morning? Why canÛªt I shake this feeling of _____?). I could relate with much of what was written: the ideas, the questions, the concerns, and viewpoints of this guy living in Baltimore.

That strikes me as a little funny when you take into account the fact that each issue is only four to six pages long. But damn does she manage to pack a lot into those tiny pages. I suppose when you are working with hand-set type, you make sure that every word counts.

This issue of Ker-bloom! is about sort of about being on a zine tour with Tomas (the editor of Rad Dad). It is subtitled ÛÏShred EverywhereÛ because artnoose brings along a skateboard and Tomas challenges her to skate in every town where it was not raining. Let me go back to the ÛÏsort ofÛ part before. While this issue is about going on tour, the insight with which artnoose leaves us is about company. I mean the kind of company that you give an old friend or maybe a stranger about to become a new friend. 

Artnoose realizes that the downside to doing a tour with a reading in a different city each night is that you deprive your host the company of a guest. Sure, she acknowledges that there are many ways to be a bad guest, but being able to host someone who is doing an interesting project is invaluable. These are how we create connections and culture and movements, not through a collection of online friends. 

This issue made me long for the days of being on tour (even given my love-hate relationship with the whole thing). It also gave me an even greater appreciation for all the people that stop by and stay with us for a bit to help out. 

And if this issue hadnÛªt won me over enough, she punctuates the whole thing with a quote from one of my favorite Good Clean Fun songs, Who Shares Wins.""

My grandma, worried that her 3-year son had not spoken a word yet, had him chase down a grasshopper. Diligently, without complaint, the boy did and returned with a smile. Open she said; confused but with hesitation, he opened wide. Wide. She shoved it in and closed his mouth. Hablas, mijo, hablas. He spit it out crying. Crying and yelling. He has not stopped either since she says and smiles thinking of her now 50 year old son talking his time away in a New Mexican state penitentiary.

This is my father. He smiles when he tells this story now on a snowy day to my children in his trailer on the outskirts of town. He has been out of jail for a year now. My kids look to me for guidance. Do we believe? I can only smile. Teasing, my father says, Û÷what mija you donÛªt believe me? Come here IÛªll tell you more.Ûª

I realize this is so central to my parenting. Stories. But I did not know this when I became a father. I didnÛªt know those afternoons or early mornings when my partner had to leave to culinary school and I had to discover what to do for the next eight hours that I was talking to both my newborn son and myself. I was showing us they way. I was imagining the path home. Telling myself, telling my son that success is possible, that despite my fear, my ignorance, my loneliness this path was traversable. ItÛªs the stories that we tell each other that create connections, that foster empathy, that teach.

But we arenÛªt the only ones telling tales. I see now how storytelling works in a cultural, social level as well; how myths of capitalism, christianity, patriarchy are told over and over and over until our kids tell them back to each other while at play, to their teachers in their homework, to us if we listen during those tucking ins at bed time or in the quite hours when we wake up together in our bed. This is linguistic terrorism. I have also come to see how itÛªs our cultural stories that impact our kids more than any one thing can, more than parents, more than teachers.""

Of all the pictures of the devastation that hurricane Katrina wrought, there was one that stopped me cold, that had me mesmerized, overwhelmed, that just seemed to contain all that I wanted to believe about fathers, no, not even fathers, just simply the men in our lives. The picture transcended all the racist media spin, it eased the pain of the decimated street scenes, the moments of panic. One man. One child. Not his even. He was wading through water; he was holding that child like it was the most important thing he could do, like not just that childÛ÷s life but his life depended on their safe arrival. He asked no questions about whose child it was, no need to ascertain ownership, or ask permission. no pathetic excuses about needing to wait and see, to try hard like we kept hearing from the ÛÏmenÛ in charge. He just knew: I help this child, I help myself; I help all of us get by. There was such humanity embodied in his arms, in the determination in his eyes. It spoke to me as the epitome of ÛÏfathering,Û of caring for not just our immediate family but all our relations. I just stared and it reminded me of how much of an impact we can have on the children in our lives, how easy it is to overlook, to forget, to deprioritize others as we take care of our own. A few weeks ago a young boy who has been in my life for years now, a boy whose father has not been around, a father who breaks my heart and is all that is wrong with the ÛÏmenÛ in our society, ÛÏmenÛ and their disposable offspring. Well, this boy was with his mother and was looking at one of those mirrors that elongates and distorts its reflection; he stared at himself, made a muscle, and said Û÷look, itÛªs almost as big as TomÛªs.Ûª When I heard this story I again realized, as with the picture, how fathering is something all men do whether we want to or not, whether we are prepared for it or not. So it is incumbent upon us to think through who we are and how we affect others especially the children in our lives. Whether we are parents or not. I had this argument a few weeks ago about this with a male non-parent who said itÛªs not his responsibility to know how to be around kids. He believes this because of the silence around parenting, around its public perceptions of children being seen not heard, of good behavior, of issues of ownership (if it ainÛªt my kid why should I care or being oblivious to creating and fostering kid friendly spaces). I know friends who take diversity training courses to be prepared for when they work with people of colorÛ_but there is no conversation about working with parents, outreach to parents, ways to make actions, spaces, conferences, whatever, parent and child friendly.""

This is long overdue, and I fight the urge to just not do it at all. Sometimes I feel that maybe the new fathers should be the one to start this. Or that I, having been a father now for fourteen years starting when I was twenty-one, am too old, too complacent. Well, perhaps this will get me off my ass. IÛªm thirty-five, a father of three and ready to get this party started. HereÛªs one of my stories: as a young father I realized very quickly how isolated I felt on the playgrounds of San Francisco, how little community there was for us. Now playgrounds have long been revolutionary breeding grounds for women and other caregivers, to sit and talk, to bond, to laugh, to find support, to pass on information and education; I canÛªt tell you how many times I have found peace of mind hearing someone tell me that what my daughter has was just like what hers had and that if I do this or that things would be ok. Sometimes empathy is the most revolutionary thing. But I was a guy, and I was welcomed and am grateful for that, but I still felt on the outside, not really part of that oh so tight inner circle. Damn my cock! Although I know cocks donÛªt always make men and men donÛªt always have cocks, but thatÛªs an essay for another time.

Where were the men; there werenÛªt that many that seemed to hang around playgrounds, but by looking around at all the kids there certainly were a lot of men doing a little somethin, somethinÛ_but again -- where were they?

It was around this time that someone, again on the playground, showed me a copy of hip mama. Wow! Immediately, I wanted one for dads. Now the problem with me is that I tend to think that others will do it better than me, that if IÛªve thought of it then at least twenty others have probably done it already. So I did nothing, but waited for it to fall in my lap.

It never did, and I went on to father two more children with a wonderful partner, to begin a teaching career, to discover anarchist theory that helped me challenge myself and my politics and values, to reconnect with chicanismo and with my own father locked up in la pinta for most of my teenaged years; I struggled to incorporate feminism, environmentalism, and activism into my life and my parenting, to explore unskooling and discipline, to watch as other men became fathers. At some point, I finally picked up the pen to take my writing more seriously, to trust my voice and my experiences, to write for myself in other zines and journals. But during all that time, I never ever discovered that magazine for dads. Until now.

But this project seems daunting. I fear people will think IÛªm being narcissistic: like who does he think he is callin himself a rad dad; I also worry that there is too much to say, too may important issues about race, about class, about patriarchy to address and that this can only be a failure, so why say anything at all. And well all of this might be true. But fuck it; here it is, read it to your kids (I did), your friends, give it to the men in your life as well as the women; forget gender and just give it to everybody. I give you rad dad as a proto-type hoping that it will lead to that community I still long to be a part of, those circles where us fathers can chew on parenting that isnÛªt based in sexist, out dated gender biases, and yet that can be honest and open though about those same pressures and images we face daily. I hope this continues with me and other fathers. Because I know there are so many fuckin cool dads trying to parent in these dangerous times in loving, meaningful, authentic, and ultimately revolutionary ways. This is for you.""

This is the Rad Dad ""heavy topics"" issue; its pages are concerned with talking to your kids about topics you might shy away from -- important issues like racism, sexism, death, domestic violence, police brutality, and environmental crisis. Rad Dad is, as always, about communication, about not shutting off when your kids need help making sense of the things happening around them. And sometimes that's the hardest part -- when you yourself are fighting to make sense of a changing terrain. Says Tomas in the zine's intro, ""For my family, there was violence in our neighborhood as a number of young men were killed, friends of ours were assaulted in their homes, domestic violence happened in a family we were close to. Suddenly, it seemed I was just trying to keep up with things -- let alone talk about them with my kids. But they were listening; they were witnesses to it all and witnesses to how we, the adults in their lives, reacted.""

On-the-job injuries are par for the course. The food preparation generally turns your stomach. There are no sick days, let alone vacation time. Miss a shift and lose your job.

Abolish Restaurants, a 60-page illustrated pamphlet from PM Press, chronicles the history of restaurants from France in the 1700s ÛÒ including the intimate relationship between the food service industry and the rise of capitalism, urban growth, and the industrial revolution ÛÒ to what restaurant staff tolerate today: the same songs, the same tacky decorations, the same customers, day in and day out.

Also considered are the relationships between the aristocracy and personal chefs; today, seemingly average middle-class families outsource their food preparation in a similar fashion. Most interesting are the sections that explore stress and health: how restaurant work comes in waves, rather than a steady predictable rhythm, and how food service employees are able to eat only when everyone else has been served.

The entire booklet is enthralling, especially for those unfamiliar with what goes on behind the scenes for underpaid, tip-based, non-unionized restaurant workers in North America. In the end, a restaurant-free world is hypothesized ÛÒ though to be fair, weÛªve got a number of similarly stressful low-wage jobs that should follow suit if we were to do away with restaurants.

No restaurant is immune to the shortcomings of the industry. As the pamphlet says, ÛÏAll the restaurants that have had flowery write-ups in the newspaper, that serve only organic, wheat-free, vegan food, that cultivate a hip atmosphere with suggestive drawings, still have cooks, waiters and dishwashers who are stressed, depressed, bored and looking for something else.Û Indeed.""

Ayun is working on a Zinester's Guide To New York City, and she makes some amusing comments about the Zinester's Guide To Portland - Portland culture being all about dumpster diving, bike power, solar, communalism, Generation Z, protest marching, and vegan street cred. She freaks out that she will write a positive review of a NYC restaurant that has meat on the menu and will be branded a big, old, cud-chewing, slack-uddered symbol of mainstream oppression.
In 'A Mother Goes To The Movies', Ayun writes about seeing the documentary Babies. She excerpts a couple of snarky reviews of this doco from The Onion and Time Out. These reviewers have the theory that one only need watch a few short YouTube videos of babies and that's sufficient, baby-wise. Kyle Smith, a reviewer from the New York Post comes in for special treatment, Ayun has one of the (African) mothers from the doco review Kyle Smith. Pretty funny.
There's a piece on Little Women, the novel by Louisa Marie Alcott. I haven't read this book myself, the only thing I know about it is Moe (owner of Moe's Tavern from The Simpsons) likes to read it to hospital patients as part of his volunteer work, and he gets very emotional. Ayun surveyed a large group of women she knows and got their favourite character from Little Women (most of them like Jo). The funniest response was from Little MoMo, actor: ""I never read that fuckin' book."" Also Jenn F., librarian: ""I found them all annoying. I tried to re-read it recently and couldn't get even a few pages in.""
Finally, Greg (Ayun's 'significant other') exposes the pilates scandal and why women can do it and men can't. That one was pretty damn funny too.

Dave articulates his experiences with such poignant honesty that every issue has brought me to tears. This was no exception, although it was the most optimistic thus far. Dave writes in the introduction that Û÷The feeling of a slow dimming of my life has stopped and I can enjoy being alive againÛª but before the zine is done he recounts experiences of a painful colonoscopy, the modern doctorÛªs poor bedside manner, a change of medication and the diagnosis of another medical condition. In DaveÛªs case, itÛªs more like heÛªs experienced enforced hardship rather than enforced positivity, but his zine is far from whingey. ItÛªs a beautiful and very human depiction of suffering and surviving. DaveÛªs reflections on nurturing oneself as opposed to trying to be strong have made me wonder about the definition of strength: rather than being limited to the heroic masculine figure doing battle, I think that the ability to nurture yourself and others is a form of strength.""

The Ghosts of Ready Reference is sort of like the shit-hot Found, but narrows its scope to one set of found items: bits from the ready reference card file from a public library, where apparently the author works as, you guessed it, a reference librarian. See, before you could just Google any random fact you needed to know, librarians were cutting out wisps of information and gluing them to little cards: sort of an analog search engine. Now these card files are going the way of the buffalo, and the author of Ghosts has salvaged some choice ones and preserved them in this zine. Interspersed throughout the entries (ranging from an illustrated guide to necktie tying, to how one properly displays the stars and stripes) are transcripts of on-the-job interactions with the drunk and insane (classic: bug-eyed freak looking for information on how to make money by fucking). Not only does Ghosts profit from the eclectic fun of anything archaic and out-of-context, it could actually be useful: if I ever go camping with a deaf person, the entries on sign language, the rates at which various kinds of wood burn, and how to determine the wind chill factor will come in mighty handy. A precious little slice of vanishing Americana. ÛÒBrian Howe""

Czech One Two #1 is about DanielÛªs experience apprenticing on an organic farm in Loudon County, VA. Daniel doesnÛªt try to romanticize the experience, he just tells it how it is ÛÒ drenched wardrobe, 3am wake-up calls, abusive bosses, and all.

Daniel doesnÛªt want to discourage people from working or apprenticing on organic farms, he just wants people to know that it isnÛªt always sunshine and rainbows. He shares some tips in the zine for people looking to get into organic farming. He also talks about the weird dynamic between lifelong farmers and the upper-middle class office lackeys who join after reading books like OmnivoreÛªs Delimna. Daniel also sprinkles in some illustrations and a soundtrack list (sadly, I only had one of the albumÛªs listed, Old Crow Medicine Show, but it does work well with the zine).

Daniel assures us that the next issues probably wonÛªt be about farming. Whatever they are about, IÛªll be sure to check it out.""

Cindy is and has been involved with many anarchist and activist projects, including the annual Renewing the Anarchist Tradition conference, the Institute for Anarchist Studies, the Institute for Social Ecology, and Black Sheep Books.

This talk contributes something new to the existing literature on anarchism and education. It is essentially a synthesis of various anarchist approaches to education, and Cindy links these approaches to larger projects and movements for social change. She describes and embraces alternatives to traditional education ÛÒ alternatives to the alternatives, even. Much has already been published on the problems with traditional education, so itÛªs refreshing to read about CindyÛªs experiences with activities that we might not necessarily have understood as educational projects. She emphasizes that these examples of educating for freedom are more than just different ways of doing education; they are necessary parts of the process of prefiguring, right now, what we want our world to look like.

Tara starts with a voyeuristic trip into her motherÛªs closet and returns occasionally to the concept of clothes and identity. I wish sheÛªd stuck with this idea all the way through, as I think a small girl exploring and remembering her mother through the clothes she wore is a fascinating image. I would like to have seen more pieces around this idea, but those might be a different set of writings for another time. Fashion does get mentioned often, and in interesting ways, but it is not always in keeping with the title. Sometimes the complex relationships between mothers and daughters can only be told in vignettes, and Tara does a wonderful job of this with her short pieces. Mothers and daughters will understand and resonate with the intricacies of Tara and her mother. But while this zine does remark upon the experience of being female and is a fabulously sophisticated read for the literary-minded of us, it strikes me as slicker and more McSweeneyÛªs (a very ÛÏhip lit mag ragÛ that was spawned, along with the likes of Zadie Smith and Sarah Vowell, by a glossy circle of writers out of San Francisco) than the fresh cut-and-paste grrrl zines we adore.

Homobody is not quite a comic but not quite a literary zine - instead it is a series of captioned drawings, dedicated to exploring the world of queers who don't take drugs and go out to clubs every night but would rather stay home and read a good book. Over time, recurring characters have developed and many formats have been experimented with. 

The first issue of Homobody appeared in December 2007. The next issue was released in April of 2008, the third in June of 2008, and the fourth in November of the same year. The fifth issue appeared in October of 2009. The sixth issue was published in June 2010 and featured interviews with comics creator Robert Triptow, and the zine archive project QZAP, as well as contributions by Robert Kirby . 

It is a black and white photocopied 1/2 size zine.

The author of Travesty is a cisgendered male who likes to wear women's clothes.

The physical presentation of the zine, which has a flowery cloth cover and total boy handwriting inside, at least for the Preface and Deface (love that!) is a nice representation of the author's self-perception/representation. (Since the author identifies the work as semi-anonymous, I'm not naming him here, in case you're wondering.)

The bulk of the content is word processed and accompanied by retro clip art, and the whole thing I think is relief printed in some fashion, i.e. not ink or laser jet, but I'm kind of ignorant about that sort of thing.

Again, as someone who consumes chick zines almost exclusively, I was pleasantly surprised to find the author so self-reflective and honest. It's not that I don't think men can be self-reflective and honest, it just seems to me that they are more likely to reveal themselves in layers, like a chess game, or in a more joking, distancing manner than Mr. Travesty does. I knew the author a little from a zine discussion list and Facebook, but really had no idea at the depths of his inner life. Or that he had a Marilyn Manson thing going on!""

Since I never got around to it with #18, I'd better just get to #19 right away. I will start by saying LOVE Miranda. It's one of my favorite zines.

It's a pretty simple object--a few drawings in each issue (mostly by Haas's partner/baby daddy) and a border on the cover, created by Haas herself. The table of contents doesn't change much from issue to issue. There are a few essays--often about Haas's childhood, politics, or some kiddie band on whose bass player all the local moms have a crush--the motel of lost companions, in which she reminisces about some long-lost acquaintance (e.g. babysitter, babysittee, someone from where she was stationed in the Peace Corps), stray thoughts, overheard quotables, tantalizing book reviews (Kate has really good taste in literature!), and a recipe.

The writing is also rather simple, which is not to say dull. In the beginning of this issue she rails on people who say they're not interested in mamazines because they don't have kids. I would agree that Miranda should be appealing to anyone who likes intelligent, thoughtful writing with a good sense of humor. Kate Haas doesn't smack you over the head with any of this though.

Things that I liked about this issue in particular:

    Mamazine rant. ""What I want to know is, what makes people who happily read all kinds of other zines think they get a pass to dismiss parenting zines - simply because they're not parents?""
    Her essay about the horrible maternity clothes that her mother passed down to her and why she came to appreciate them.
    Learning what she taught when she was a high school English teacher. She says she wasn't that great (passionate), but I suspect otherwise.
    Booklist: Kate reads a variety of books--historical and literary fiction, sf, memoirs, some YA and children's books, and other random titles. She gives one or two sentence description/reviews, which is all you really need. (Why, why, why am I going on so long, when clearly I'm not even in a good reviewing groove? Because I really like Kate and her zine, and I'm not going to get around to writing her a letter telling her so, and I'm hoping this will serve in lieu of more personal correspondence.) btw She has The Sparrow on her list, which I also describe as ""Jesuits in space"" and have read more times than I can remember.
    ""It was obviously time to review with Simon the distinction between two key southeast Portland demographics, hipsters and hippies.""
    Toddlers and sticks story.
    A particularly poignant Motel of Lost Companions tale.
    Finally, I'm not sure, but it looked to me like Kate might have done some of her own illustrations this time. They looked different. I think all non-artist zinesters should give this a shot. 

Maybe I especially relate to Kate because we're close to the same age. We're leading very different lives, but even without a bunch of pop culture references to place her in my end of GenerationX, I just sort of get her.""

Well, with a piece of irony that hasn't escaped me, that was shortly followed by the sad sad news that mixtapezine will in fact fold at the end of this year. The majorly awesome, and indeed zeitgeist-detecting, editor and creator Justine has an expanding family and no-doubt a squillion other commitments. Having achieved more than she ever dreamed of when setting out, she has made the decision to knock the zine on the head, but promises more from the mixtape brand in 2011. I wish her all the best and I'll be waiting (not so) patiently to see what she has up her sleeve for the future. So...... more reason than ever to get hold of the penultimate printed issue of mixtapezine. Issue 13, the 'All Around The World' issue, plus various back issues are available here.

It's edited by Liam Warfield, with contributed articles by Eleanor Balson and Aaron Smith, and honestly, it reminds me of something Aaron might make. Liam helped put out the Chicago newspaper Skeleton News until it folded, and then attempted to have some of his stories published in mainstream publications. He found that experience frustrating, alienating, and ultimately chose to self-publish some of those pieces here in this zine instead.  The first article is a lengthy biography of a Chicago musician named CJ, who wrote and performed her songs, despite a long history of illness. It's an inspirational story for weirdos everywhere. Drinking With The Wizard is all about an afternoon spent at a wizarding seminar. Swinging in the Streets is a great piece on a New Orleans band the Loose Marbles, who play on the streets of N.O. Aaron Smith's article, The Maw, is about trying to keep up and buy in to what the rest of society is doing, but feeling unfulfilled as a result. And finally, Eleanor Balson writes about the thoughts and adventures of an injured bee.""

We hope that, as you read, you feel like 20 of your friends are telling you their awkwardly intimate tales. The idea behind this project is that many of our friends have been reluctant to share--and claim ownership of--stories of their less-than-perfect sexual experiences; to do so would be to admit that they were not having the porn-perfect, stably monogamous, heterosexual sex that is socially dictated to them. Rather than seeing this ideal as a flaw in the social fabric, many women continue to see it as a personal shortcoming: they are unattractive, clumsy creatures; they should expect physical discomfort or emotional pain; they are frigid or they are whores. In sharing their stories, the women in this zine reject these degrading notions of womenÛªs sexualities and take a decidedly empowered view on what awkward sex teaches us about ourselves and our desires.""

The author, Joey Alison Sayers, was kind enough to trade with me. I hope she enjoyed my zine, although now I canÛªt remember what zine it was that I traded with her. Anyway, I enjoyed this comic a lot. Joey is a real pro in the way that she tells her story of transitioning from male to female. The story is told in quick little vignettes. It doesnÛªt necessarily go in chronological order, but Joey chooses to tell the real emotional arc of the story instead. This approach is very effective. Because itÛªs a comic, obviously the treatment of the subject is lighthearted, but Joey still manages to convey the importance of this transition for her and the greater society. I like this way of telling stories- no big spotlight shined on transgender folks- itÛªs more like- ÛÏthis is my personal story, thanks for listening.Û Another thing that I appreciated about the comic is JoeyÛªs decision to include a list of terms in the back of the book to let you know exactly what she means when she uses the words ÛÏtranssexualÛ or ÛÏtransgender.Û You can visit JoeyÛªs website: www.jsayers.com""

That issue was by far the most popular in the series. How to top that? A reader requested that we explore the psychological aspects of bicycling next, and so the forthcoming issue (#6, Lines on the Map), hones in on the mental and emotional aspects of riding a bike. 
In #6, a talented pool of writers explores the satisfaction of riding up a difficult hill, the frustration of navigating unwelcoming streets, and the subtle and not so subtle ways the routes and landscapes we ride through shape our identity and our experiences. These essays reveal some of the constraints and the liberties of the maps -- mental and physical -- that we take for granted, and open a conversation about how we can draw new lines of our own. 
This issue has a guest editor: Katelyn Hale, of Curiocity Printing. Katelyn is also producing a beautiful print for the cover (the project picture is one of her brainstorming sketches) and a limited edition block print poster that is available at some rewards levels to some lucky backers. As those of you choosing to subscribe will find out, more exciting thing are to come this year.
Taking the Lane is, depending on your perspective, a polished and professional zine or a quarterly journal of feminism and bicycling with a scrappy, personal appeal. It is published by Elly Blue (who also publishes TakingTheLane.com). Readers and contributors have a major hand in shaping the zine's evolution. Every issue of this zine has been funded on Kickstarter: Thank YOU!""

But what I didn't know is that he's a huge baseball fan. Well, he was the biggest fan as a kid, and when the Phillies went back to the World Series, it reignited his passion for baseball. This issue of his zine is all about that, and has tons of childhood photos of a young Kelly with famous baseball players. He also ties his love of baseball into his taking hormones, and transitioning in a really personal examination of gender and sports. Kelly talks about how his relationship to his father has changed over time, and how baseball helped them cross certain divides. Kelly also discusses his yearning for a safe space where people with different gender identities can enjoy sports, without worrying about bigoted attitudes. This zine comes with an insert, a quarter-sized zine of a paper young Kelly wrote for school in 1995, called Prejudice in Baseball.""

The reviews that follow are but a few examples of portrayals of artists and their work in film and television. We have watched hundreds of hours of video and concede that our research has only just begun. 
This guidebook and a parallel DVD and installation we have produced are the first output of ongoing research that Temporary Services is undertaking. The DVD includes clips of scenes from films and television shows that highlight some of the best and worst portrayals of artists that we have found. These clips are organized into various categories--for example, clips of fictional and real artists talking about their own work, and scenes where fictional artists behave in an inappropriate manner. 
Continuing stereotypes of art and artists in mainstream media reveal to us the real impact (or lack thereof) that artists have on the world around them. The minimal presence of living, working, visual artists in these media spheres contributes to the kinds of generalizations and misunderstandings that many people seem to have about the power and function of the visual arts. It is our contention that by continually watching, cataloging, and analyzing these portrayals, artists can also gain a better understanding of their own responsibilities to their viewers and how stereotypes hurt their ability to effectively communicate their ideas.""

For us, the Temporary Conversations series is not just a fun opportunity to sit down and talk to someone we like about their work (in this case, for well over two hours!); it is also a chance to put a lot of fresh information out into the world. In Peggy Diggs' case, her projects are infrequently given sufficient space in print to unfold in the detail they deserve. This is an extraordinarily generous interview, filled with a lot of heart and clear, focused recollections on the circuitous paths Diggs' collaborative projects take.""

Both of these groups were founded by bassist, vocalist and producer Nanjo Asahito. Nanjo, along with ""Motor Cycle Guitarist"" Munehiro Narita and a succession of drummers, led the trio High Rise from the early 1980s until the early 2000s. High Rise took the classic rock power trio formation of groups that began in the late 1960s like Cream, Blue Cheer, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Guru Guru, tossed in bonus helpings of free jazz improvisation and threw it on the back of a tricked out punk rock motorcycle after drinking gallons of espresso. Their sound is characterized by extremely distorted and mixed 'in-the-red' production that gives the already fast and blisteringly loud rock music an even greater nervous energy.
Temporary Services has been fortunate enough to see Kawabata perform in many [...] configurations over the years. We are big fans of not only his music but his playful and flexible approach to collaboration and group identity. Kawabata frequently talks about attempting to channel the sounds of the cosmos in his music but he was refreshingly down to earth and filled with good humor when he sat down to speak to us. This interview was conducted by Salem Collo-Julin and Marc Fischer of Temporary Services in the basement of the Chicago club the Empty Bottle. It took place a few hours before Acid Mothers Temple's show on May 5, 2007. All of the photos in this booklet were taken by Temporary Services at the same show.""

Instead, every summer we'd load up the wagon and my parents would my sisters and 1 camping. We grew love swimming in the lake, reading in hammock, roasting marshmallows the campfire and going for long The appreciation of nature such a strong part of me that at age 26, 1 would much rather camping for a weekend than ride a rollercoaster or stay in a hotel.
If you feel the same way, Marta Chudolinska's new zine collection of strips, that originally appeared on OpenBookToronto.com, will appeal to you. It's filled with car drives, mosquitos, rowboats and tall trees. It's rife with nostalgia for childhood and summers spent in the wilderness. And her illustrations are darling and heartwarming.
If you're the kind of person who has to have a mattress under them to sleep, pick up something else. But, if you're the kind of person who remembers counting stars and running your fingers through the waves as you skip across the water, grab this zine. Then write to Chudolinska and suggest she expand this into a full graphic novel. That's what I'm going to do. (Harley R. Pageot)""

Each page contains a new face surrounded by words - for the most part the words are a story that the person tells about themselves or about something they experienced or about something they heard - it's usually a conversational dialogue - it's all about my interaction with the person while I'm drawing them. The idea for PEOPs happened while I was touring the world in a band called God Is My Co-Pilot. Sometimes we would be in a new place almost every day & there was usually time between setting up equipment and the show to get to know the locals. I always had my sketchbook and would draw people just out of habit. The conversations were very interesting because many time people were speaking English as a second language so the way that they phrased things was often very poetic & beautiful...so I would write down the conversations. At some point I realized I had a collection of drawings of people & stories. I thought it would make a great zine. After that I started going after people & making them sit for me & tell me stories. The format became much more structured & refined.

The important thing for me in doing these portraits is the idea of a documentation of a hidden history of everyday life - all the people I have met - artists, activists, writers, travelers, anarchists, poets, cartoonists, pilots, musicians, psychologists, moms, kids, dads, grandparents, punks, dykes, trannies, drug dealers, teachers, squatters - you get the idea. The categories are endless, but the idea is that everyone has an incredible story to tell & everyone deserves a voice everyone deserves to be listened to.""

While there are still a few times during Blurt! that Lew has missed proofreading , the story is crafted to perfection. Any individual that has attended college, even for the shortest period, will be able to draw parallels from their to LewÌ¢âÂã¢s life, and be that much more affected by the content of this issue. The sheer amount of improvement that Lew has made between just two issues is amazing, by the second issue of Blurt! I couldnÌ¢âÂã¢t honestly put the zine down until I had finished it. The layout is still astonishingly simple; border, text, sometimes a chapter/section number, but this works for Lew. Blurt! is not your average zine, as Lew is a great enough writer that I could honestly see this being released as a novel, it winning a number of awards, and finally being included as part of the required reading in college campuses the world over. We are left with a decent ending for this iissue, but put forth in such a way that I want to immediately pick up a copy of issue #3 and figure out what has been happening to Lew in the meanwhile.

It is often mysterious and goes undiagnosed, but can stem from injury, illness, surgical complications, or can be an inherited condition. Because it is a condition that is invisible, pain often goes without treatment or validation. The chronic pain experience is not just about the physical sensations, but also has serious emotional and social implications.
Finding good information and meaningful dialog about chronic pain can be challenging. Many of the resources out there are very clinical, too general, or are written from outside the pain experience. There are few voices by folks with chronic pain about their struggles and how they keep living as full a life as possible. This zine attempts to begin to fill the empty space with a diversity of voices telling their stories. We hope that by publishing these essays people will feel a greater sense of permission to speak out. Further, we hope to create more community for those with chronic pain and their allies.

An iconoclast among its peers, Clamor is an unabashed celebration of self-determination, creativity, and shit-stirring. Clamor publishes content of, by, for, and with marginalized communities.
