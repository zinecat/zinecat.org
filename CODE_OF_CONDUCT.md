# Participation Guidelines

All are welcome and encouraged to participate in The Zine Union Catalog.  The Code of Conduct for ZineCat is currently under construction following the guidelines set out by [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/)

## How to treat each other

* Be respectful and welcoming
* Try to understand different perspectives
* Do not threaten violence
* Empower others
* Strive for excellence
* Don’t expect to agree with every decision

## Inclusion and Diversity

ZineCat welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

ZineCat-based activities should be inclusive and should support such diversity.

## Raising Issues at #zinecat

If you believe you‘re experiencing practices at #zinecat which don‘t meet the above policies, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact zinecatproject@gmail.com.

#zinecat organisers reserve the right to refuse the contributions of anyone violating these policies, and/or take further action including expulsion from the project.

Email: zinecatproject@gmail.com

## Working in the Open

Because working open is important to ZineCat, #zinecat program planning is done in the open on Github (check out our repo [here](https://github.com/lsrkthelibrarian/zinecat.org)). We hope participants will benefit from this culture of transparency and collaboration, and will continue to work with an open ethos in their projects.

Thank you to [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/) for providing a framework for this open project
